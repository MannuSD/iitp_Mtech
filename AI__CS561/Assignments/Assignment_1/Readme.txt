Note: This assignment is solved using jupyter Notebook. So, kindly install it on system and open the file "puzzle.ipynb".

Files:
1. puzzle.ipynb : This find contains the code to solve the 8 puzzle.
                  There are some configuration paramerts provided so that if need they can be used.
                  Below are the configuration parameter:
                     print_solution : (True/False) - This can be used to print the solution at then end
                     max_depth : This parameter can be used to set the max depth/ Setting it 0 means unlinited.
                     max_states_to_be_checked : Maximum number of states to be explored. setting it 0 means unlimited.
                     type_of_algorithm: "BFS"/"DFS" : configure the type of algorithm that we want to use.
